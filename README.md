# Formalized Mathematics

This repository collects together my notes on topics in the formalization of mathematics. At the moment I am primarily interested in learning how to write mathematics using a proof assistant called [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community). I aim to develop some material to help introduce mathematics students to Lean.
