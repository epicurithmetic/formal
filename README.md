# Formalized Mathematics

This repository collects together my notes on topics in the formalization of mathematics. At the moment I am primarily interested in learning how to write mathematics using a proof assistant called [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community). I aim to develop some material to help introduce mathematics students to Lean.


### Inspiration :cloud: :books: :thinking:

The notes and work I have collected here are the result of reflecting on countless discussions, and many hours reading a number of books and webpages. I list here a number of the key (and free) resources that I have enjoyed and learned a lot from:

  - [Logic Matters](https://www.logicmatters.net/) an extensive collection of notes on formal logic and metamathematics.
  - [Introduction to Formal Logic](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/)  with an emphasis on Lean.
  - [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/). 
  - [Type Theory and Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/) provided free by the author, Simon Thompson.

Rarely would I copy others work exactly in my class notes. However, if something has been copied verbatim, then I should have attributed the source. If I have missed something, then please let me know - I am happy to fix those errors.
