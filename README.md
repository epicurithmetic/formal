# Formalized Mathematics

This repository collects together my notes on topics around the process of the formalization of mathematics. At the moment I am primarily interested in learning how to write mathematics using a proof assistant called [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community). I aim to develop some material to help introduce mathematics students to Lean.

This repository contains the following:

  1. [Notes and slides](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/formal/tree/master/notes) for a class I teach about logic and the mathematical foundations of computing.
  2. Notes and programs/proofs from my learning about Lean. 
  3. [ASCII art](https://github.com/epicurithmetic/formal/tree/master/turingMachine) depictions of computations done on Turing machines. 
  
I intend to develop this repository over the coming years. I aim to add the following:

  - Logic and computation course material
    - [ ] :: Full set of class notes to complement slides.
    - [ ] :: Lean versions of logic tutorials.
    - [ ] :: Introduce type theory to the notes and tutorials.
    - [ ] :: Introduce the Curry-Howard isomorphism to the notes and tutorials. 
  
  - Teaching materials for Lean 
    - [ ] :: Explain logic proof methods in context of the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation.
    - [ ] :: Student exercises: Translate pen-and-paper exercises into Lean examples. 
    - [ ] :: Student exercises: Translate natural deductions into Lean proofs. 
    
  - Turing machine ASCII art
    - [ ] :: Write code to generate .gif representations rather than the static .txt output.
    - [ ] :: Fix the end-of-file bug.
  
  
### Inspiration :cloud: :books:

The notes and work I have collected here are the result of reflecting on countless discussions, and many hours reading a number of books and webpages. I list here a number of the key (and free) resources that I have enjoyed and learned a lot from:

  - [Logic Matters](https://www.logicmatters.net/) an extensive collection of notes on formal logic and metamathematics.
  - [Introduction to Formal Logic](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/)  with an emphasis on Lean.
  - [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/). 
  - [Type Theory and Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/) provided free by the author, Simon Thompson.

Rarely would I copy others work exactly in my class notes. However, if something has been copied verbatim, then I should have attributed the source. If I have missed something, then please let me know - I am happy to fix those errors.
